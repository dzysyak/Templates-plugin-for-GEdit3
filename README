About plugin
I have created this plugin just for myself, very simple (mainly becaus I am not a python programmer). 
So, if you have some fixes or ideas, your help is very appreciated. Let me know if you have better one, 
as I am very interested in such plugin.

Installation
1/ Copy both files to ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins.
2/ Enable "New file from template" plugin under plugin configuration.

IMPORTANT!
For Ubuntu (and probably for some other distros) you should change python3 to python in template.plugin file.

Configuration
By default plugin looks for templates in ~/Templates. You can change this by editing the source.

More information can be found here (here you can ask a question too):
